# 🔍 Python Keylogger (For Educational Purposes Only)

## About
This project is a simple Python-based keylogger designed as part of my learning journey in cybersecurity. It demonstrates concepts like keyboard event listening, file handling, and Python scripting using the `pynput` library.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is created strictly for **educational and ethical use only**. It must never be deployed on machines, networks, or environments without explicit and lawful consent.

## Features

- Logs all key presses to a local text file (`keyfile.txt`)
- Detects and handles special keys such as **Space** and **Enter**
- Allows graceful exit by pressing the **ESC key**
- Simple and easy-to-read code with error handling
- Developed in a virtual environment for dependency isolation
